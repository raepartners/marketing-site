> "I think the robots are writing better, more reliable code than our dev team"
> — A client's CTO, reflecting on their first quarter with AI coding agents

The last three months have been the most exciting and terrifying acceleration of AI coding capabilities we've seen since we started building [Hominy](https://hominy.ai), our property management platform. Exciting, because it's now faster and better (not to mention 100-1000x cheaper) for us to produce fully-tested, QA-verified, web-scale software using agentic coding tools instead of humans alone. Terrifying, because as operators and technical leaders we're now outnumbered 20-to-1 by profoundly capable robots working 24/7 on our most critical systems and business processes.

Think of it like L3 autonomous driving: we can now safely take our eyes off the road most of the time, but god-forbid we fall asleep at the wheel.

## What actually unlocks autonomous engineering

We've learned a tremendous amount about steerability and reliability of agentic AI systems—both building Hominy and helping several very large enterprises deploy agentic coding tools themselves. Beyond navigating the rapidly-evolving ecosystem of models and tools, the most impactful investments you can make to unlock the power of your robots are the same you should have been making all along to unlock your engineers:

- **Thoroughly-documented code** — Agents need context to make good decisions
- **Comprehensive automated tests** — The only reliable way to verify agent output at scale
- **Well-supported modern frameworks** — Agents work best with patterns in their training data
- **Rigorously-researched technical specifications** — Clear requirements prevent agents from spinning
- **Production-equivalent development environments** — Reduce the gap between agent output and reality
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** — Reproducible environments agents can understand and modify

The good news is that agentic coding tools, paired with well-trained architects, can bootstrap those best practices in weeks, not years. The bad news is that inexperienced operators can use those same tools just as easily to produce what *looks* like those best practices, and instead send your human devs and robots spinning indefinitely.

## 2026: The year it becomes real

This is the year hands-off, eyes-off autonomous engineering becomes possible for mature organizations—at least the ones that learn how to hold agentic coding tools and their operators accountable to high-quality outcomes.

Kyle (CTO) and I have spent the last few years figuring out how to do just that: manage dozens of agentic coding agents working simultaneously and reliably hold them to producing software that exceeds the expectations of product and engineering requirements. Our battle-hardened in-house tools and practices are finally in a place we can share them, and we're eager to help others responsibly deploy autonomous engineering.

We're also building [Lightfield](/products/lightfield), an observability platform for AI coding agents that makes the invisible visible—helping you understand what your agents are actually doing and whether they're meeting your standards.

## Let's build together

If your organization would benefit from building software much better and faster (and cheaper), or you want to help us build, use, and teach these tools, we'd love to partner with you.
